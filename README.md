**THE COLOR BOX GAME**

**The Color Box Game** is just a simple and basic informational game I designed and created in the course of 
making my baby steps in JavaScript. I wanted something new and simple from all the simple projects around.
I wanted to practice:

1. Basic Js Functions
2. How to use addEventlistener Method
3. How to use the getElementsBYClassName Method
3. How to add simple texts to the  HTML Documents dynamically
4. Working with variables etc.


**HOW THE COLOR BOX GAME WORKS**

On loading the browser, the game prompts or notifies you that **You Are about to Learn Some New Colors** and
Endeavour to read the instruction before playings.

It basically consists of 12 random boxes filled with different colors. By randomly clicking the any of the boxes,
the name of the color is revelead. Suprisingly the name color name will likely didfer from what you must have guessed.


On successfully rvealing all the names of the all the 12 colors, Please feel free to reset/refresh the Game Board
by pressing the Reset Button. 

**THE Color Box Game** is built with:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

It also mobile responsive and great to serve as an ice breaker in a JS begginer class.
